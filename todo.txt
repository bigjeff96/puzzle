+ Have the puzzle shuffle change the orientation of the pieces
* Have the solver be able to deal with the pieces being in the wrong orientaion
    - Be able to exit out of a long chain of "fitting" pieces until you can't find any piece
      (with all possible orientations)
* Have a Jigsaw puzzle generator than can generate puzzles where the connection types are not unique (Ignoring the BORDER)
* Be able to find "all" the solutions from a single jigsaw puzzle
* Have a way to serialize/deserialize a puzzle and its solutions (maybe a way to distinguish unique solutions found from the sover)
* Use multi-threading/create multiple processes to do a large search of puzzles with just 2 solutions (and which the 2 solutions are very distinct)
